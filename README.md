# Simple Carbon Model

This repository contains an implementation of a simple carbon model.

## Model Overview

The model takes a list of bank *Transactions*, and calculates the carbon *Footprint* of each one.

Each *Transaction* has a *Business Type*, which is referenced by a `businessTypeId` property on the transaction.

Each *Business Type* has an *Emissions Factor* which is measured in *kg of CO2-equivalents per Â£*.

The *Footprint* of a transaction is the transaction's `amount` multiplied by its business type's emissions factor. In psuedo-code:

```
footprint = transaction.amount * transaction.businessType.emissionsFactor
```

In `src/model.ts`, the `applyCarbonModel` takes a list of transactions and business types, and returns a new list of transactions, which each have an additional `footprint` property added.

## Getting started for development

### Installation

You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

Install the necessary dependencies with:

```bash
$ npm install
```

### Running

You can run the model with:

```bash
$ npm run model
```

You can run the tests with:

```bash
$ npm run tests
```

### Files

* `src/data.ts` - Contains example transactions and business types that the model is run on
* `src/types.ts` - Contains shared Typescript types that are used between files
* `src/model.ts` - The implementation of the model
* `src/run.ts` - A wrapper script to quickly run the model on the example data in `src/data.ts`
* `src/tests/model.test.ts` - Tests for the model
